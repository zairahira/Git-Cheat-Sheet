# Installing GitHub

- [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com).
- [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com).
- [Git for All Platforms](http://git-scm.com).

# Configuring git for the first time
Configure user information for all local repositories

- ## Configure email
Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions:
```
git config --global user.email "[email address]"
```
## Configure name

Sets the name you want attached to your commit transactions:

```
git config --global user.name "[name]"
```

# Setting up SSH keys
To push your changes to the remote repo, you would need the SSH keys set up.

You can use the command below in `git bash` and get a pair of keys.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C <email>
```

**This would generate 2 keys- public and private**

##  Add public key to your github account
Login to your account and navigate to settings.

![img](./images/ssh-keys.png)

##  Add private keys to ssh agent.

- `start ssh agent: `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`

- `ssh-add <your-key>` or `ssh-add ~/.ssh/key`.

# Workflow of changes

Changes are made locally in the working area.
Then they are staged and then pushed.

![img](./images/Workflow.png)

## Staging changes
Stage files for tracking them by using the command: `git add`.

The command below adds all the files in the repo to staging area:

```
git add .
```


## Committing changes

Once changes move to the staging area, you can commit them with a proper commit message.
See section [Writing a good commit message](#git-commit-messages)

## Pushing the changes

To push your changes to the remote repo, you can use the `git push` command.

```
 git push origin main
```
Here, main is the name of the branch and can be replaced with another branch you are working on.


# Working on changes from remote repository to local machine
- **Cloning**
Clone a repo by going to a specific repo and selecting `https` from `code` button.

![img](./images/clone-repo.gif)

# Working on changes from local machine to remote repository

In your current directory, initialize the git repository using `git init`.

To push the changes, create a repo in GitHub.
- Link the remote repo: `git remote add origin <ssh-link-to-remote-repo>`.
- Verify of the branch has been added: `git remote -v`. 
- Push the files and changes: `git push origin main`.

**Set upstream  manually:**
- To set upstream: `git push -u origin main`.
- Once set, now you can simply use `git push`.

# Git branches
>üí° Tip and good practice: Always make changes in a forked branch.

Branches fall into these categories:
- **Main**: The original/main branch.
- **Feature branch**: Used when you are adding a feature.
- **Hotfix branch**: Created for bugs in production releases. Used as a patch for next release cycle.

Branches often start with fix/ or feat/, among others, like commit messages, but they use a forward slash and can't contain spaces. Create a new branch named feat/add-create-table-reference

## Check which branch you are on.
`git branch`

## Create and switch to a new branch
`git checkout -b <branch-name> `


## Switch to an existing branch 
`git checkout main`.

## Push to a feature branch
`git push origin <feature-branch-name>`

## Delete branches that are not in use
`git branch -d feature-branch`

## Checking out Pull Requests
Once you have the codebase cloned locally, you can use this command to test a particular PR:

`git fetch origin pull/<PR-Number>/head:new-branch-name`

Then, checkout the branch and view changes in the PR.

`git checkout new-branch-name`

[Check GH Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/checking-out-pull-requests-locally) for details.

# Forking

Forking creates a copy of the original repo in your account.
Then you can make changes in a branch and then create a PR(Pull Request)

![img](./images/fork%23.gif)

# Upstream- adding and reviewing upstreams
## Add main upstream of original repo

When attached, remote branches tell the repo from where to push and pull the changes.

Remote branches can be added using this syntax:

```
git remote add upstream <ssh-of -orignal repo>
```

> Note: you can add any other name instead of `upstream` and use it to refer the repo.

Use HTTPS to avoid SSH keys

```
git remote add upstream <https-of -orignal repo>
```

When fetching from upstream,
- Switch to master: `git checkout main`.
- Fetch: `git fetch upstream`.
- Merge changes: `git merge upstream main`.

> `git pull` does `git fetch upstream` and `git merge upstream main` in one go.

![img](./images/Capture.PNG)

## Push changes to remote
`git push origin <branch-name>`

Make sure upstream is configured.

# Reverting changes
## Restore/ revert commits

- Unstage a file locally
This would revert `git add .`
Command:

```
git restore
```

- Revert to a particular commit

```
git reset commit-id-to-revert
```

- **stash**- If you don't want to commit and don't want to loose the new changes.
`git stash`
You can come back to them later.

`git stash pop`

- Remove a commit already pushed to Github:
	- Find the commit ID
	- `git reset commit-id` > this would unstage the file.
	- `git stash` > place those changes in a stash.
	- Force push(`-f` ) as commits are linked: `git push origin branc-hname -f`
 
#  Additional information
## How to Recover a Deleted File in Git ‚Äì Revert Changes After a Hard Reset
### Revert file after committing changes:
**Method:1**

- Find hash ID, use: `git log` 
- Revert change: `git checkout <hash-id>`

**Method:2**

- Find hash ID: `git reflog`.
- Revert change:  `git reflog <hash-id>`.

### How to Recover Files When Changes Are Staged but Not Committed

- Find dangling blobs: `git fsk`.
- View details: `git show`.
- Save in a file: `git show <hash-id> > output.txt`.

# Git commit messages

The commit message should follow a structure like this:
This makes it easy to understand your changes in a glance.

```git
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

Some commonly-used conventions.

-   `chore:`  Changes that don't change source code or tests.
-   `docs:`  Changes to the documentation.
-   `feat:`  Added new feature.
-   `fix:`  A bug fix
-   `build:`  Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
-   `style:`  Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
-   `test:`  Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

# Git logs
Git logs use 'pager' to navigate and search the logs.

By default, the newest commits are shown at the top.

> Logs show only those commits that lead up to the current branch. They do not show the entries for the entire repo.

### Navigation
To scroll along the logs, use up and down arrow keys.
You can also use `j` and `k` as used in `vim`.

To move to the beginning of the log/ first line use `J`(capital J)
To move to the last line of the log, use `gg`(small`g`)

You can exit by simply pressin `q`.


### Formatting

- Reduces commit IDs to short ones:
```
git log --abbrev-commit
```

- Changes the date formats:
```
git log --date="short"
git log --date="iso"
git log --date="unix"

```

- Change the order or track the parents of a commit:
```
git log --oneline
git log --oneline --reverse
git log --oneline --parents

```
`git log --oneline` will display a simplified view of the Git commit history, with each commit summarized on a single line. Here's an example output:

```
f4a7d83 Add new feature
62e256c Fix bug in login page
da8259b Update README.md
5ca84fd Initial commit
```

`--parents` prints two columns where the second column shows where the current commit(1st column) orinigated from, i.e the parent.


```
65a7b0f9f 830763da0 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) fix: update scripts + remove unused (#49740)
830763da0 607111978 fix(curriculum) - clearer mongoose install and set up instructions (#49754)
607111978 803688b62 fix(deps): update prisma monorepo to v4.11.0 (#49758)
803688b62 1c793d39b fix(deps): update dependency @stripe/stripe-js to v1.49.0
1c793d39b c94962a82 chore(deps): update dependency joi to v17.8.4
c94962a82 9710c9ec8 chore(deps): update babel monorepo
9710c9ec8 04ee95dc3 chore(deps): update automerged always - codesee to v0.536.0
```

### Filtering
These commands filter the logs according to date ranges

```
git log --oneline --before="1st April 2023" --after="1st April 2022"
git log --oneline --since "3 months ago"
```

#### More details on logs
You can always refer to the man page for more details: `man git-log`


# Making your organization public.
If you have recently joined an organization, you have to make it visible on your profile by setting it to `public` in the settings.

# Google cloud course
## Diff changes

```
git diff
git diff --staged
git show commit id
```


## Undoing before committing

Restore modified file before staging
```
git checkout your-file.txt
```

## Undo after adding to staging

```
git reset 
```
```
# untracked in working tree and no longer staged
git reset HEAD file-to-unstage
```

## Amending commits

```
# amends the commit message of latest commit
git commit --amend
```
you can also stage another file, then `commit --amend` to override the previous commit message.

> use locally only and avoid using remote

## Rollbacks - rolling back after pushing changes

```
# Revert to last commit
git revert HEAD
```

Rolling back with `revert`, deletes the added lines, adds a new commit opposite of the current commit.

commit and revert commit both is shows in logs

## Identifying the commit id and rolling back

```
git revert commit-id
```

## Logging

```
# Shows the graph

git log --graph --oneline
```

To throw the merge away:

 ```
# resets to where the merge never happened

 git merge --abort
```

## Remotes

```
# Shows remote info

git remote show origin
```
**Sync remote and local**

```
# copies the commits to see what is there

git fetch
```

```
# merge the fetch changes

git merge
```


## Bonus
Reverts pushed changes to github till the commit id
also removes the history from the UI

```
git reset --hard c880ed6
git push -f
```

# Push to someone else's branch:

1. Clone the branch locally:
`git clone --branch remote-branch-name https://github.com/user-name/repo-name.git`

2. Make changes
`git add`.

3. Commit and push- make sure you have the rights to push to that branch.

`git push origin remote-branch-name`.


# Combine commits into one commit

To combine all the commits into a single commit in Git, you can use the "squash" feature in an interactive rebase. This process will rewrite the history of your branch, combining all the commits into a single new commit. Here's how you can do it:

Start an Interactive Rebase:
First, you need to start an interactive rebase session. If you want to squash all commits from the very beginning of your branch, you need to find the commit hash of the first commit in your branch. Alternatively, you can use HEAD~n syntax, where n is the number of commits you want to squash.

For example, if your branch has 10 commits and you want to squash them all, you can use:

```
git rebase -i HEAD~10
Mark Commits to Squash:
Your default text editor will open with a list of commits, each starting with the word pick. It looks something like this:
```


```
pick 01d1124 First commit
pick 6340aaa Second commit
pick ebfd367 Another commit
```


To squash all commits into the first one, change pick to squash (or just s for short) at the beginning of each line except the first one. It will look like this:


````md
pick 01d1124 First commit
squash 6340aaa Second commit
squash ebfd367 Another commit
...

Complete the Rebase:
Save and close the editor. Git will start the rebase process and squash the commits. If there are no conflicts, it will then open up a new editor window to combine the commit messages.

Edit the Commit Message:
In the new editor window, you'll see all the commit messages combined. Edit them to create a single, new commit message for the squashed commit. Save and close the editor.

Force Push (if necessary):
If you have already pushed your branch to a remote repository, you will need to force push the changes because you've rewritten the history.

`git push origin your-branch-name --force`

````
